clangd already knows your code. **C Call Hierarchy & References** re-presents what it knows the way you actually want
it: callers **and** callees at once, references split into **reads vs writes**, and third-party noise
filtered out — without leaving the sidebar.

> It does **not** run its own language server. It consumes your C/C++ provider's results through VS Code's
> provider commands, so accuracy equals your provider's — with zero extra setup.

## ✨ Features

### Call hierarchy — incoming or outgoing
Put the cursor on a function and run **Show call hierarchy**. The tree shows **callers (incoming)** or
**callees (outgoing)** — flip between them with the toggle in the view title. Nodes show the function's
**parameter types**, a **×N** badge when clangd merges several call sites into one, and are cycle-safe and
depth-capped. Selecting a node **previews** the call site — selected, centered and briefly flashed — while
**focus stays in the tree**, so you can keep arrowing up and down the hierarchy. On a **×N** node (several
merged call sites) you can step through the sites two ways without leaving the tree: press **Enter**
repeatedly to preview each in turn (wrapping around), or re-click the inline **Open in editor** action to
open each for real. Either way the walk is **per-node** — arrow to another function and Enter/Open acts on
*that* node, never the previous one. The inline **Open in editor** action also moves focus to the editor.

### Find references — read vs write

**Find references** opens a dedicated tree where every occurrence is badged:

- <b style="color:#E69595">w</b> — **write** (assignment, `++`/`--`, compound assignment)
- <b style="color:#8FC79F">r</b> — **read**
- <b style="color:#5FB7C9">&</b> — **address-of** (`&x`) — a potential write through the pointer
- <b style="color:#D7BA1D">d</b> — **declaration / definition**
- **·** — unknown (e.g. inside a macro)

Group by **folder** or flat by **file**, toggle which kinds show with the **w r d ·** chips, and the
matched symbol is highlighted on each line. Read/write comes from clangd's `documentHighlight` roles, with
a syntactic fallback when the provider doesn't tag a role.

### One filter for everything
A fixed **Filter** pane at the top searches by **function name or path** across both views, live:

| You type | Match |
| --- | --- |
| `bus` | case-insensitive **contains** (name or path) |
| `src/net/**` | **glob** |
| `/drv_\d+/` | **regular expression** |

Matches are also **highlighted in the call tree** — the part of the function **name** (or, when the query
matches the **path**, the path shown next to the name) is tinted, so it's clear at a glance why a node is shown.

## ✅ Requirements

- A C/C++ language provider with call-hierarchy support, installed and active — **clangd**
  (`llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`, recommended) or **Microsoft C/C++** (`ms-vscode.cpptools`).
- A project index your provider can use: a `compile_commands.json` or `compile_flags.txt`.

> If both **clangd** and **ms-vscode.cpptools** are installed, make sure clangd is the active C/C++
> provider for best read/write accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Install this extension and a C/C++ provider (**clangd** recommended), and open a C/C++ project it can index.
2. Click the **C Call Hierarchy & References** icon in the Activity Bar.
3. Right-click a function → **Show call hierarchy** / **Find references**.

## ⚙️ Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cCallHierarchyReferences.maxDepth` | `32` | Max expansion/walk depth for the call tree. |
| `cCallHierarchyReferences.showSignatures` | `true` | Show caller parameter types in the call tree. |

> Filtering by name/path is done live in the **Filter** pane — there are no glob settings.

## 🧠 How it works

For call hierarchy, references and signatures the extension calls VS Code's built-in provider commands
(`prepareCallHierarchy`, `provideIncoming/OutgoingCalls`, `executeReferenceProvider`,
`executeDocumentHighlights`, `executeHoverProvider`) which delegate to **your C/C++ provider**. No second language
server is spawned.

## ❓ FAQ

**Nothing shows up.** Make sure your C/C++ provider (clangd or Microsoft C/C++) is installed, active, and
has finished indexing — clangd gives the most accurate read/write classification.

**Read/write looks wrong.** Read/write is recovered from clangd's highlight roles; if another provider
answers without roles, a syntactic fallback kicks in. Globals/struct fields are the clearest demo.

**Both callers and callees are shown — can I get only one?** Expand just the branch you care about; the
other stays collapsed.

## 🛠️ Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run compile      # or: npm run watch
```

Press **F5** to launch an Extension Development Host with the bundled `example-large/` project (regenerate
or scale it with `node tools/gen-large-example.js`).
